# 🚀 100 Days of Data Science Projects

Welcome to my **100 Days of Data Science** challenge!  
The goal: **1 project per day for 100 days**, covering the full spectrum of data science — from fundamentals to advanced AI and real-world applications.

This repository is a **living portfolio** of my journey, designed to demonstrate consistent learning, hands-on practice, and professional documentation.

---

## 📅 Roadmap Overview

The projects follow a structured roadmap (from beginner to advanced), inspired by my 100 Days of Data Science Plan:

- **Foundation Phase (Days 1–20):** Core Python, data cleaning, statistics, visualization  
- **Intermediate Phase (Days 21–60):** Machine learning, deep learning, NLP, specialized domains  
- **Expert Phase (Days 61–100):** Research-level topics, MLOps, real-world applications
