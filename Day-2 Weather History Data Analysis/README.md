## 📌 Features
- ✅ Data loading & cleaning (`weatherHistory.csv`)
- ✅ Basic statistics & missing value checks
- ✅ Weather condition distributions (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- ✅ Correlation analysis between numeric variables
- ✅ Time series patterns (hourly, weekly, monthly trends)
- ✅ Visualizations (distributions, time series, heatmaps)
- ✅ Advanced analysis (outliers, extreme values, seasonal trends)
- ✅ Automated report & export of results
- ✅ Interactive exploration guide
